# Internship Linguistics

This page shows the code I used during my Bachelor's Internship for the Linguistics program at Radboud University (LET-TW-STAGEBA). The ExtractXML notebook was used to parse the xml file from Taalportaal. The TransformData notebook was used to analyse the Qualtrics survey data.
